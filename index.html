                Without friendship, we will be lonely. It fills the loneliness and makes life worth. Friendship can form
                between
                anyone. Sometimes, men and animals are seen to be good friends. They love and care for each other. We
                should
                respect our friendship and love our friends. May God let friendship forever in our lives.
