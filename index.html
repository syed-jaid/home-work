            <p class="with-hafe">
                Without friendship, we will be lonely. It fills the loneliness and makes life worth. Friendship can form
                between
                anyone. Sometimes, men and animals are seen to be good friends. They love and care for each other. We
                should
                respect our friendship and love our friends. May God let friendship forever in our lives.

            <h3>Someone who is a true friend stands up for you. When others try to hurt you emotionally or physically,
                they
                do
                everything they can to make sure you stay safe. They don't care who is trying to harm you; they will
                defend
                you
                anytime, anywhere. If they can help you, they'll do it without reservation or reward.
